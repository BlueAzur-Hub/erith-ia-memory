# Agent-Crypto 40.6.96 — Strategy A Paper V2 Auto Proof

Parent: 40.6.95
Engine: Market Core 38.15.11 (unchanged)

## Scope
- Run the existing `AgentCryptoStrategyAPaperAfterCostAcceptance406063.run()` once automatically after page load.
- Preserve the existing lifecycle and after-cost owners.
- No forced Paper trade.
- No real order, Kraken order, wallet, credential, network call, storage write, recurring timer, or observer added by this layer.

## Expected runtime proof
The existing `PAPER V2 · LIFECYCLE + AFTER-COST ACCEPTANCE` panel must move from EN ATTENTE to PASS/FAIL without an operator click. Its own state-preservation checks remain authoritative.

## Protected
Aether, Atlas CURRENT, Oracle, Lecture Technique, Web Classic and Market Core are untouched.
